# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the monorepo
2. Select the packages you want to include in the changeset
3. Choose the version bump type (major, minor, patch)
4. Write a summary of the changes

## How to release

1. Create a changeset for your changes
2. Merge your PR to main
3. The release workflow will automatically create a "Version Packages" PR
4. When the "Version Packages" PR is merged, packages will be published to npm
