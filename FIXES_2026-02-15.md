# Fixes Applied - 2026-02-15

## 1. Routing Fix ✅
**Issue**: Links on `/components` page were using `#section` anchors which don't work because the sections only exist on the homepage.

**Fix**: Changed all category links to use absolute paths with anchors (`/#forms`, `/#navigation`, etc.) so they navigate to the homepage sections.

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/routes/components/+page.svelte`

## 2. Card Styling Fix ✅
**Issue**: Card count badge used gradient with text clipping which looked weird in some cases.

**Fix**: Simplified to use CSS variable directly: `color: var(--mljr-primary-600)`

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/routes/components/+page.svelte`

## 3. Component Warnings Cleanup ✅
Removed all unused CSS selectors to eliminate build warnings.

### 3.1 OtpInput State Reference
**Issue**: `length` prop was referenced in initial `$state` value, which only captures initial value.

**Fix**: Moved to empty array initialization with `$effect` that watches `length` changes.

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/forms/OtpInput.svelte`

### 3.2 Unused Dark Mode Selectors
**Issue**: Components had unused `[data-theme="dark"]` and `.dark` selectors that aren't used since CSS variables handle dark mode.

**Fix**: Removed all unused dark mode selectors from:
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/forms/Label.svelte`
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/forms/Fieldset.svelte`
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/navigation/Menu.svelte`
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/feedback/RadialProgress.svelte`
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/display/Kbd.svelte`
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/display/ChatBubble.svelte`
- `packages/mljr-svelte/src/lib/components/overlay/Collapse.svelte`

## Remaining Warnings (Expected)

### Autofocus Warning
**Warning**: `src/lib/components/forms/OtpInput.svelte:122:6 Avoid using autofocus`

**Status**: This is a best practice warning, not an error. The `autofocus` prop is controllable by users and defaults to `true` for UX convenience. Users can set `autofocus={false}` if needed.

### $app/environment Warning
**Warning**: `Avoid usage of $app/environment in your code`

**Status**: This is expected for SvelteKit libraries and doesn't affect functionality.

## Build Status
✅ Build passes successfully
✅ All critical warnings resolved
✅ Only 2 expected warnings remain (accessibility recommendation + SvelteKit library pattern)

## Components Added Today
